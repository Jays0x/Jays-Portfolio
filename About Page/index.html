            <p>Hi, I'm Jays, a product (UI/UX) designer with 3 years of experience in the field. I have a strong background in both UI and UX design, and have worked on a variety of projects ranging from mobile apps to websites. I developed a solid foundation in design principles and user-centered design methodologies.
            I am passionate about creating intuitive and aesthetically pleasing designs that provide a seamless user experience. 
            <br><br>
            I believe that good design should not only look good, but also solve real problems for users and enhance their overall experience. In my previous roles, I have been able to contribute to the success of several products through my design skills and problem-solving abilities.
            I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a designer. I am a proactive learner and am constantly seeking ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest design trends and technologies. 
            </p>
