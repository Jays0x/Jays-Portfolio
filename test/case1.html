                <div class="line1"></div>
                <p>Web3School platform is an e-learning platform that utilizes blockchain technology to offer students a variety of courses, opportunities to earn rewards and interact with peers, mentors, and industry professionals. It aims to provide them with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in today's job market.</p>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <div class="line3"></div>
                <p>The problem that E-learning platform faces is that students lack motivation, resources, and concentration when it comes to continuing their studies. This lack of motivation can stem from a variety of factors, including a lack of clear educational goals, a lack of relevant resources, and a lack of engagement with the material being studied. Additionally, students may struggle with distractions and a lack of concentration, which can impede their ability to learn and retain information. As a result, students may struggle to complete their coursework, or may not achieve the level of understanding and proficiency that they desire.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="solution">
                <h2>Implemented Solutions</h2>
                <div class="line4"></div>
                <p>The proposed solution for the problem of lack of motivation, resources, and concentration among students is to create a platform that incorporates features such as earning while learning, live classes, group work, assignments, empowerment program, and program planning. These features can help to increase motivation, engagement, and learning outcomes among students.</p>

                    <h4>Research</h4>
                    <h2>Who Are The User?</h2>
                    <p>To begin with, I have to understand my audience. Who are the people trying to learn skills in web3 and what are they trying to solve? I need to empathize with them to understand their challenges. I came up with the ideas of conducting research to understand if I’m really addressing their needs and pain points by putting the objective of the research in mind.
                    <br><br>
                    We have many skills and services under web3. To make a difference, I looked into those fields one by one. I’m able to be more enlightened in the field and understand what they are trying to solve. There are many service under web3 such as blockchain development, Web3 product management, Web3 Product design, Web3 cyber security etc. it almost confident that people in the fields are my target audience based on the project mission (To help people learn web3 easily and how to use the platform to transit to web3 with their skills).

                    <h2>Jumping Out Of Assumption</h2>
                    <p>To build usable products, you need to be out of any assumption. I need to do research on the challenges people are facing when trying to learn about web3 and how it works.
                    <br><br>
                    Before I do research, I asked myself the type of research methodologies to use for my research. After thinking about the approach to use, I decided to use 3 methods, user interview, behavior analysis and questionnaire To gather much insight from people.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./Image/Method (2).png">

                    <h2>Preparation For The Research</h2>
                    <p>When I've decided the type of research methods to use, I have to prepare for the question and how to approach them. I recruited 5 of my friends who are also trying to learn about web3. They gave me the date to meet and I added it to my calendar. While waiting for the time, I prepared my question for the questionnaire. I sent the questionnaire to a group of developers, product managers, product designer, software engineer, and web3 enthusiast on their discord server.
                    <br><br>
                    As the research goes, I got 20 feedback from questionnaires and interviewed 5 of my friends. They gave me more details about what they're going through in learning web3 and how they can offer their service in web3 as a professional.
                    <br><br>
                    So there's still one more research left, behavior analysis. In This stage, I studied the behavior of users and their reaction with other platforms in web2. It helps me narrow down how users interact with e-learning platforms and their expectations.

                    <h2>Need To Invent A Change…</h2>
                    <p>The insight is really resonating and encouraging. I decided to analyze the insight with the help of Figjam tools. With the insight gathered, I notice many things need to be changed such as (how students interact with their teachers in the class). Majority of students need a better teaching approach to interact with their tutors. You can view the insight below to have more understanding about the concept.

                    <p>The Research prompted me to go deep into the problem by defining the problem at hand and in the future. I want to know what really causes the problem for them. I joined the insight together and used it as my problem statement. This makes me focus on one problem and indicate the root cause of the problems.                                   </p>

                    <h2>Brainstormed Ideas At Early Stage</h2>
                    <p>I've understood the problems and have seen a direction to follow to get a solution to the problem, which is a problem statement. I brainstormed ideas and looked into the appropriate solution that'll address the problem at hand. It took me 3 days to come up with a solution but there's something missing (Clarification).

                    <p>I generate many ideas but I don't know if the ideas are really a solution to the problem I'm trying to solve. To clarify my doubt, I decided to use a wireframe to understand if my solution really addressed the real pain points.                                            </p>

                    <p>In this stage, I decided to validate my doubts. I created a wireframe of the app and sent it out for testing. I wrote some questions down and asked the user when they've done with the testing. With the insight, I think my ideas are really playing along the line.
                    <br><br>
                    Wireframe helped me clarify the solutions and also helped structure how the interface would look like. Check the image below to see the wireframe.

                    <h2>Taking Steps To Change… (New Revolution).</h2>
                    <p>Web3 has come to change how web2 works. Their mission is to let the user own and have control over their data. While having the capability to control your data, you can make money along the way. The idea of helping students to be more focused, offer their service to people who need it most and help them learn more about web3 and Blockchain is really fascinating.
                    <br><br>
                    After creating a wireframe, I've understood how the app would look and how the user would navigate through the app. I conclude to give the wireframe an image and colors to observe the real look of the app.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The solution Invent to students trying to learn how web3 works and how they can use it to scale up their career really prompted me to build a real platform that solves real life problems. I wished to turn this project into a life app that helps people to learn and grow in web3 without any challenges in their way. But the challenges here is, I don't have any Developer partners with me but it's something I wish to implement if I get the chance.
                    <br><br>
                    I planned to look into more problems in other fields. As a product designer I strive to help people live a better life and help companies scale up their businesses.
